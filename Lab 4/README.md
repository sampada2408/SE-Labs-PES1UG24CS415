# Real-Time Simple Platformer Game

This project is a terminal-based platformer using **Pygame**. It introduces students to interactive game design using object-oriented principles and real-time graphical rendering.

---

## What’s Provided

A partially working version of a platformer with:

- A player-controlled character with left/right movement, gravity, and jumping
- A small hand-built level of platforms with gaps and one hazard
- Score display

You are expected to **analyze**, **interact with an AI assistant**, and **complete/fix** the game to make it fully functional.

### **Use an LLM (e.g. ChatGPT or Claude) as your debugging and pair-programming partner for this lab.**

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Clone the repo or download the project folder.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Tasks to Complete

Each task must be completed using an iterative process involving LLM suggestions and your critical code review.

### Task 1: Refine Collision Detection

> The player sometimes falls straight through a platform instead of landing on it, especially after a long fall. Investigate and enhance collision accuracy so landings register reliably regardless of fall speed.


### Task 2: Implement Game Over Condition

> Add a screen that displays the final score once the player falls off the bottom of the screen or touches a hazard, then gracefully waits for input instead of just printing to the console.


### Task 3: Add Replay Option

> After Game Over, allow the user to play again by choosing a difficulty (Easy, Medium, or Hard gravity/jump strength), or exit.


### Task 4: Add Sound Feedback

> Add basic sound effects for jumping, reaching the goal, and dying.

## Expected Behavior

- Smooth left/right movement using `Left`/`Right` or `A`/`D`, and jumping with `Space`/`Up`/`W`
- Gravity pulls the player down and platforms stop the fall when landed on from above
- Touching the hazard or falling off the bottom of the screen ends the game
- Reaching the goal at the right edge increases the score and sends the player back to the start
- Score is visible on screen at all times

## Submission Checklist

Submission is only the following three things:

- [] A 10-second video of gameplay **before** your changes, showing the bug/broken behavior
- [] A 10-second video of gameplay **after** your changes, showing the bug fixed and the new features working
- [] The Chat/LLM used page link, with the complete chat history
